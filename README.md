# packages-to-install-for-jetson-tx1
List of packages with sudo apt-get codes for 64 bit Ubuntu 16.04

##Intro
After buying the Jetson TX1, i had searched a lot of tutorials.  But no one has a list of packages that you can install on Jetson successfully.  Hence, i propose a list that contains the sudo apt-get commands to let other users also install all the packages that can reduce the back & forth of searching about the packages.
